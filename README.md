Document Title: Multi-Region Web Application Architecture on AWS
Prepared by: Tima Ali
Date: October 2025
Purpose: To design and document a resilient, scalable, and highly available AWS architecture capable of serving users across multiple regions with automatic failover and minimal downtime.

Deduced Requirements:
1.	Launch an ecommerce platform.
2.	Multiple locations 
3.	Support concurrent user sessions - responsiveness
4.	Scalable to handle high traffic volumes - scalability
5.	Process a large number of transactions - Performance
6.	Wide range of products
7.	Secure payments
8.	Personalized recommendations

Overview
This document describes the design and implementation of a multi-region AWS architecture for a modern web application. The goal is to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency for users globally.
The solution is deployed across two AWS regions US East (N. Virginia) and EU (Ireland) to achieve active-passive redundancy. Each region hosts identical infrastructure stacks including networking, compute, storage, and database components. Traffic management and failover are handled using Amazon Route 53 and AWS Global Accelerator (optional enhancement).
Key objectives of the architecture include:
•	Minimizing latency for global users.
•	Maintaining application uptime during regional outages.
•	Automating data replication and failover mechanisms.
•	Ensuring security and compliance with best practices.

Considerations:
Overview:
The multi-region web application is deployed in two AWS regions Primary (us-east-1) and Secondary (eu-west-1) each containing identical infrastructure stacks.
The architecture follows a highly available, fault-tolerant and scalable design pattern, ensuring continuous service even if one region becomes unavailable.
Traffic distribution and health-based failover are managed by Amazon Route 53, which routes users to the healthiest region based on latency or availability.
High Level Overview:
A. Global Layer
Component	Description
Amazon Route 53:	Provides global DNS resolution and latency-based or failover routing between regions. Monitors health checks to automatically redirect users to the secondary region during outages.
Amazon CloudFront:	Distributes static assets (images, CSS, JS) via a global content delivery network, reducing latency and offloading traffic from web servers. CloudFront origins are configured to point to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) in each region.
	




B. Regional Layer
Each region (Primary and Secondary) includes identical infrastructure:
Component	Description
VPC	Each region has its own isolated Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones for redundancy.
Internet Gateway (IGW)	Allows public subnet resources like the ALB to access the internet.
Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Distributes incoming traffic evenly across EC2 instances within the Auto Scaling Group. Integrated with health checks to ensure only healthy instances serve traffic.
Auto Scaling Group (ASG)	Ensures scalability and fault tolerance by automatically adding or removing EC2 instances based on demand.
EC2 Instances	Host the web application backend or API services. Configured for auto-deployment via Launch Templates or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ)	Primary database in us-east-1 with read replica in eu-west-1. Automatic failover to the replica in case of a regional outage.
Amazon S3	Stores static files, backups, and logs. Cross-Region Replication (CRR) ensures data consistency between S3 buckets in both regions.

Connectivity & Routing
•	Route 53 is configured with Latency-Based Routing and Health Checks for the ALBs in both regions.
•	In the event of a failure in the primary region, Route 53 detects the health check failure and reroutes traffic to the secondary region’s ALB automatically.
•	Internal communication between application layers occurs through private subnets and security groups enforcing least privilege access.

Multi-Region Failover Flow
1.	User request → Route 53 (evaluates latency & health).
2.	Route 53 → CloudFront → Regional ALB (nearest healthy region).
3.	ALB → EC2 (in ASG) → RDS.
4.	If the primary region fails, Route 53 automatically routes to the secondary region.
5.	Data synchronization occurs through S3 replication and RDS read replica promotion.
